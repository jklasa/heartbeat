# Deployment

There are many working parts in this system, as it eventually became largely a system designed for handing the problem of streaming data. High volumes of data are coming in and must be dealt with efficiently in a scalable manner.

Notably, when run unfettered, the system was able to ingest, analyze, and store around 20k Tweets in less than 5 minutes. Of course, this was too fast for sustainable use as Twitter API Tweet caps would be overrun too quickly with such a pace.

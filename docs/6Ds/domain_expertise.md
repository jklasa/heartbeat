# Application of Domain Expertise

The current system is very configurable, such that a user can analyze whatever they would like. As a result, the possible domains for expertise can vary greatly, but a general understanding of social networks and specific topic knowledge would be helpful for tasking the system and understanding the results. The inputs and outputs are simple, but the mechanics that drive the data are likely far from it. The Internet and social networks operate in incredibly complex webs of individual and collective human thought and influence.

The specific motivation for this project was the analysis of social influence. For this problem's tasking on the Russia-Ukraine war in particular, the involved topic knowledge broadly covers political understanding of the Russia-Ukraine dynamics. The nuances of such a topic would be suited for someone with background on these current political or idealogical issues. Experts on social media behavior, such as decision makers in social networking companies such as Twitter, would also provide critical insight into the use of the system and understanding of the data at hand.

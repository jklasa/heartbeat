# The Problem

The impact of social media is an incredibly important topic in society today. Social media sites have power for both good and bad (subject to personal opinion, of course), and every minute, an incredible amount of information is posted and shared among millions of users. That volume of data can have significant value, but how can it be analyzed, and what type of knowledge can be gained from studying it?

# The Solution: Heartbeat

Here, I propose a system whose goal will be to achieve new insight into social media trends using current and historic social media data. It will look for ways to measure social media opinion and influence via the analysis of public data. To divide this problem into a practical independent task, the analysis will focus on Twitter data, which takes the form of short, 280-character posts. Using such a system, I hope to put a metaphorical stethoscope on the heartbeat of the Internet.
As a proof of concept for the utility of such a service, I will focus on conducting sentiment analysis on domain-specific data. As I mentioned, social media sites have the power for both good and bad. Some of this is known by general users and some is not, and there are many difficult tasks and decisions social media companies and users are faced with. How do we combat disinformation campaigns? Illegal content? Where is the line drawn between free speech and the common good? There is a lot to deal with here, but one place to start with is metrics: analyzing the data and finding out what is actually out there.

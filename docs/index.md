# Heartbeat

Welcome to Heartbeat, my systems project for JHU's EN.705.603.81.SP22 Creating AI-Enabled Systems course. Use the links below and navigation on the left to access content.

# Components

## Project Documentation

This site hosts the documentation for the project and the underlying system. Explore the navigation links on the left to browse the project as they pertain to the 6Ds of creating AI-enabled systems.
 
## GitHub

The [GitHub page](https://github.com/jklasa/heartbeat) for the project hosts the relevant [Python code](https://github.com/jklasa/heartbeat/tree/main/src), [Kubernetes configurations](https://github.com/jklasa/heartbeat/tree/main/k8s), and [setup scripts](https://github.com/jklasa/heartbeat/tree/main/scripts).

## DockerHub

The images for this project are hosted on DockerHub [here](https://hub.docker.com/repository/docker/jklasa27/heartbeat).

## Code Demonstration

The system is quite large and requires a local Kubernetes cluster, but a [sample walkthrough](/demo) can be found in the navigation on the left. This walkthrough details the processes running in the cluster without running the Kafka cluster, Kubernetes node, or the database.
